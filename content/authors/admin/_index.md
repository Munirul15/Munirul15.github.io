# Biography
---

I’m a Mechanical Engineering senior at BUET with a strong foundation in operations research, data-driven material modeling, and robotics. My research spans high-entropy alloys, cognitive quadruped design, and terrain-aware interdiction models. I aim to pursue graduate study to build scalable, intelligent systems grounded in physical realism and optimized for human-centric design.
